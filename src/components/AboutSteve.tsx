                    <p>
                      My martial arts journey began in 2010 with Tae Kwon Do. For years, I felt unsatisfied 
                      with what I was gaining from it. Everything changed one night when I stumbled upon a 
                      video online that extolled the virtues of jiu-jitsu as a superior martial art.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. I walked into Gracie Barra Encinitas (CA) in 2016, 
                      and from day one, I was hooked. I quickly became a regular at the school, training 
                      consistently month after month and year after year.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      I had the privilege of training under <strong>Master Nelson Monteiro</strong> and 
                      <strong> Professor Rafael Ramos</strong>, and their guidance has been invaluable. 
                      The lessons I've learned from them have profoundly impacted my life.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      In 2023, I earned my black belt, marking a proud milestone in my journey. By 2024, 
                      I chose to retire from a <strong>23-year career in accounting</strong> to pursue 
                      jiu-jitsu full time and open my own school.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p className="text-foreground font-semibold">
                      In March 2024, I received the keys to the new school, and after three months of 
                      construction, we officially opened on June 1st. I'm thrilled to bring Gracie Barra 
                      jiu-jitsu to the Layton community and share the transformative benefits of this art 
                      with others.
